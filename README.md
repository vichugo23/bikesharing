# OVERVIEW OF ANALYSIS
This is an analysis of Citi Bike data in New York for the month of August of 2019 that has been released to the public for analysis. Given this information we would like to help our friend Kate decide wether or not it would be a good idea starting the exact same bike rental business in Des Moines.
The analysis and visualizations were created using Tableau.

- This pie chart displays how many many customers New York had for the month of August. As you can see there are two types, subscribed and unsubscribed customers. This is a good indication that the majority of the customers are subscribed which means they are returning customers.

- For the next visual you can see the top starting locations for the bike rentals. This is another indication that most of the rentals happen in one big general area with a few outliers but still in a group. This is good to see that way you know the bikes aren't being taken too far away where it would be an inconvenience to retrieve them for maintanence.
