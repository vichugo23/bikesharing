# OVERVIEW OF ANALYSIS
This is an analysis of Citi Bike data in New York for the month of August of 2019 that has been released to the public for analysis. Given this information we would like to help our friend Kate decide wether or not it would be a good idea starting the exact same business in Des Moines.
The analysis and visualizations were created using Tableau.

This pie chart displays how many many customers New York had for the month of August. As you can see there are two types, subscribed and unsubscribed customers. This is a good indication that majority of the customers are subscribed which means they are returning customers.
